# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried creating a Responsive Toggle Navigation Menu.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at creating a decent responsive navigation toggle menu. I really haven't mastered this design pattern. To be honest, there's a lot more css involved in this stuff that I don't understand 100% like position, the ::before and ::after stuff. I need to get this stuff. All I wanted was to see if I could create a cool ease-out transition effect. I was following a code snippet from the Ethan Marcotte's Patterns and Principles book.

### Day 2: Sept 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new course on Treehouse called Object Oriented Javascript by Example [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This hasn't been completed yet. This is a game called "4 in a Row". Basically Connect 4. It uses Object classes. It's a really super cool project, but I'm still not at the level to building something like this on my own. I have to start thinking of coding project ideas that are at my level. It's gonna be a process.

### Day 3: Sept 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** This course is way over my head. I'm following along, but this is way to big of a project for me. It's also been a long day for me, so I'm pretty fused. At least I'm getting quicker at typing code. At least I'm learning that there's still so much I need to learn. 

**Link to work:** [OOJ By Example](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/KxXGmb)

### Day 4: Sept 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Treehouse's  Object Oriented Javascript by Example course. [Link](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-by-example)

**Thoughts:** Ok. This is super complex. I just copied the code provided from the lessons or would simply pause the video to type it. Of course I would stop and watch the video and go through the code a bit to understand what's happening. I think I understand what's going on on a general level. This a very component like way of coding. Very similar to React I would say, but with plain ol' vanilla JavaScript. Every component in the the game is a class. One the most complicated pieces of code is the checkForWin method in the Game class. If there's anything I learned in the past three days about this, is that there's so much I need to learn. not just JavaScript, but computer programming in general. I wouldn't know how to code up an application or a game because I have a hard time breaking things down to tiny little systems like that. 

I'm gonna keep pushing tho. I need to go down a bit, and find simpler things to do. The game should work tho.

### Day 5: Sept 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Going back to simpler stuff. 

**Thoughts:** I had an idea for a personal project. It's a work related idea, so I don't think it's appropriate if I share all the details, but the gist of the project, or what I want the app to do, is to filter through an array of objects. The object or array will catalogue employee names and their skills. According to their skills, I can arrange them in a particular way. 

I think this is a more purposeful way of deliberately practice coding with JavaScript. 

Everyday it's a struggle for me. But I'm gonna keep on. Linking to the code, but right now it does absolutely nothing.

### Day 6: Sept 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Shooters Project 

**Thoughts:** Right around the end of the coding hour, I finally figured out how to accomplish something by myself. I was attempting to loop through an array of objects using more of the newer array iteration methods, but I was not getting the result I wanted. After a while of digging and looking for ways to loop through arrays and objects, I finally landed a simple solution with a for loop. I think I finally really understand how a for loop works. 

It isn't much what I accomplished today, but it's a start. 

**Link to work:** [SHOOTERS](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/dqJKWP)

### Day 7: Sept 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Shooters Project 

**Thoughts:** Did a bit of code refactoring. I realized that I was repeating the same for loop three times, when that was completely unnecessary. There was really just three conditions. I managed to use the Math.floor(Math.random() method as a way to print out to console random shooters. Still figuring out how would I have a shooter not have the same location on the same dip. There's probably going to be some more conditional statements to get this working. 

I'm really starting to enjoy this. Loving the results I'm getting. Coding is so cool. 

**Link to work:** [SHOOTERS](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/dqJKWP)

### Day 8: Sept 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day

**Thoughts:** Today was more of a study day. I completed a short Treehouse course on Objects, which is useful or could be useful in the future for my Shooters project. I also completed some Free Code Camp Excercises. There's a lot there that I can keep doing. A the end of the hour I played some more with my shooters project. Still trying to wrap my head around something that a human brain could understand and do without describing every single tedious step. Basically, the idea is to automate and print out something that can take an hour for a person to do. I'm positive that I'll find the right approach.

### Day 9: Sept 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Started a course on Treehouse on Vue Js. Digging it. Basic day. Vue is basically a class object. Pretty cool.  

**Link to work:** [Vue JS](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/wEXQoz)

### Day 10: Sept 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Second day of going through Treehouse Vue Js Basics course. So far I think this is a really nice framework. It's certainly a bit easier to get into than something like React. The templating syntax already feels familiar to me since I have played with things like Jekyll and customizing Wordpress themes. 

**Link to work:** [Vue JS](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/wEXQoz)

### Day 11: Sept 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day / Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Woke up super early this morning. At about 4:30am. Trying to mix this up to see if this would be a better time. I'm almost done with the course. I'm working on building a flashcard web app that lets you add a card. It's really cool.

**Link to work:** [Vue JS / Flash Card App](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/jvpRBK)

### Day 12: Sept 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Vue Js Basics Treehouse Course

**Thoughts:** Had a day off today so started early. I completed the Vue JS Basics course. I'm really digging Vue. React was a challenge to grasp, but I still think it's an awesome tool. Vue on the other hand is very easy to grasp. I think I'm gonna keep learning and playing with Vue. 

The flash Card app was completed. I also completed a [practice course on treehouse.](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-vuejs-templating)

### Day 13: Sept 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Practice Vue Js

**Thoughts:** Woke up that the crack of dawn to start my coding hour. I'm really loving Vue. It feels more intuitive to use. I worked on a [Treehouse practice course on Vue Js list rendering](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-vuejs-list-rendering.

### Day 14: Sept 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Random Day

**Thoughts:** I feel like today was an unproductive day. I did one hour, but I wasn't really focused on something in particular. I started out working on one of my projects. I started last night working on it. I just want to make a simple webapp where you can add cards with info, you can edit an instance of a card, and you can add or delete cards. I just been struggling to give this data a structure that makes sense. I tried making it with Vue, but I can't wrap my head around it. I'm having a hard time simplifying it. 

**Link to works:** [Random Day](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/BOGxdK) 

### Day 15: Sept 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was a good Day

**Thoughts:** It's funny. Today I didn't really go for a specific end goal, but I ended with a more functional web app. But more importantly, I figured things out on my own by taking each idea step by step. I'm still playing with Vue and I'm slowly falling in love with it. I don't know if it's because it's easier to understand or if this daily coding challenge is starting to help me think like a coder, but today simply was a good day. What was good about today is that I felt that everything that I've been studying and learning so far is starting to materialize in my brain somehow. 

**Link to works:** [Vue Js Form Inputer Thingie](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/oPJRQb) 

### Day 16: Sept 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Code Pairing and Some More Vue

**Thoughts:** Today I screencasted and chatted with a coder buddy. We talked about Vue, frontend, and coding in general. We are starting an emoji memory game. After that I started another [intro Vue JS course](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js) It's another nice intro. The intro courses are free, but there's a lot of stuff there. Haven't finished it yet, but what I liked about it is that they really teach you the concepts behind each of the vue directives like v-bind, v-show vs v-if, and their shortcuts.

### Day 17: Sept 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Early morning session

**Thoughts:** Got up about 5:30am today. Started my hour around 5:40 or so. Mostly it was a study session. Read more of the Vue docs. Created a Vue component and tried to implement it to the emoji cards.  

**Link to works:** [Vue Component](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/zJbwmy) 

### Day 18: Sept 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: The Tweet Box

**Thoughts:** Started working on another tutorial today. I think this is a good one. It's not too above my level, but not too low. I'm past the intro tutorials, so this excercise is perfect. It's basically a recreation of the Twitter compose interface. [A Vue.js introduction for people who know just enough jQuery to get by
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vue-js-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by-eab5aa193d77) This is seriously helping cement the the concepts on how a Vue instance works. 

**Link to works:** [Tweet Box](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/LJvLrG) 

### Day 19: Sept 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished with the Tweet Box

**Thoughts:** Finished with the [Tweet Box tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vue-js-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by-eab5aa193d77) Not exactly sure how the photo uploading functionality works, but this gives me something more to look into. Didn't make the modal work, because I though it was unnecessary. I also started playing around with Regular Expressions. I'm on this chapter with [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html). 

**Link to works:** [Tweet Box](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/LJvLrG) 

### Day 20: Sept 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about JavaScript Regular Expressions aka Regex

**Thoughts:** I've been reading the Eloquent JavaScript book, a book I highly recommend to anyone who wants to dig a bit deeper into JavaScript. I'm on the chapter on Regular Expressions, but it got to a point where I started getting lost. Since I knew [Treehouse had a course on it](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/regular-expressions-in-javascript) I decided to start on it. The course gives you a breakdown on how regex works. Basically it's a way to write string patterns that you can test against. The course gives you a project so you can validate a form. This is pretty nifty.

**Link to works:** [Regex / Form Validation](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/ZMNZvg) 

### Day 21: Sept 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Regex Course

**Thoughts:** Finished the [Regex course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/regular-expressions-in-javascript) There's something wrong with the Telephone validation. Something is broke in there, but that's allright. The user, password, and email validators are working. Basically the tooltip will stop showing up once the conditions are met. This stuff is super cool.

**Link to works:** [Regex / Form Validation](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/ZMNZvg) 

### Day 22: Sept 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Image Slider with Vue

**Thoughts:** Made an Image Slider with Vue. Followed [this tutorial](https://matthiashager.com/image-slider-vuejs-tutorial). One thing I'm starting to notice when I do tutorials is I'm spotting syntax typos. I understand most of the code in this one. Not sure exactly what's going on in the computed function. All I know is that it's literally doing some math and makes the slider not crash, particularly when you hit the prev "button". 

**Link to works:** [Slide](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/YOmOeW) 

### Day 23: Sept 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Modular CSS with Sass

**Thoughts:** Today was a hard one. I tried waking up early because I knew I was going to be out all day. I did manage to do 45 minutes in the morning. I put in some extra 15 minutes almost at midgnigh. I started a course on [Treehouse on Modular Css](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/modular-css-with-sass) It's super interesting advanced stuff with SASS. Loving the fact that you can make funtions with SASS. 

**Link to works:** No link today

### Day 24: Sept 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started JavaScript 30 Course

**Thoughts:** I have been meaning to start this one for a while. I know lot's of folks that have started the 100 days challenge are familiar with [Wes Bos Build 30 Things in 30 Days with 30 Tutorials ](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5aa411a64f754d18086b2db9/view/194130581) This are the kinds of projects are ready for now. I'm also still reading up on SASS, modular CSS, and generally trying to improve my CSS game. 

**Link to works:** [JavaScript Drumkit](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/bmNVwz)

### Day 25: Sept 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a Clock

**Thoughts:** Made a clock using CSS and Js by following the day #2 tutorial of Wes Bos JavaScript 30. It's a pretty clever sort of hack of using transform-origin, transform: rotate(), and the transition-timing-function property. The JS was just 20 lines and the trick is using the new Date function. Then it's all abou the setInterval function. Pretty cool stuff. I finished making this in about 30 - 35 minutes. I spent the remaining time watching the Treehouse tutorial on modular CSS with SASS.  

**Link to works:** [CSS and JS Clock](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/GYgGLM)

### Day 26: Sept 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Updating CSS Variables with JS

**Thoughts:** Third project with Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course. Today is was about using CSS Variables, not SASS, but the new CSS variable implementation, and updating it with JS. Another thing I'm getting surprised about are these input range types that I didn't know. There's a couple of things I had forgotten about HTML. I didn't even know about the kbd element either. I think it's time I brush up on my HTML. 
  
This was also a very quick project to complete. After I was done I started watching on [Treehouse the NPM Basics Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics)

**Link to works:** [CSS Variables](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/rqVeyq)

### Day 27: Oct 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio and Treehouse NPM Course

**Thoughts:** Today was all about array methods. Methods like filter, map, sort, and reduce. I'm still not sure how reduce works. I was done in half an hour. After I was done with that I continued with the Treehouse NPM course. 

**Link to works:** [Array Methods](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/rqVeyq)

### Day 28: Oct 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Flex Panels Image Gallery

**Thoughts:** The fifth project for Wes Bos JavaScript30 was more CSS that JS. It was all about Flexbox. Most of the magic is done with the transform property which translates the Y position of the top and bottom paragraphs, which in this case are the two words in each image panel. There's also a really cool transition effect that uses the cubic-bezier method. Finally, the basic thing that JS does in this exercise is toggle classes when the panel is clicked and also when a "transition ends". 

**Link to works:** [Flex Panels](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/zmvVvb)

### Day 29: Oct 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fetching Data

**Thoughts:** Today was project # 6 of Wes Bos JavaScript30. This one was a little more involved. I basically used the fetch api. I also took my time going line by line and understanding what each part is doing. There's a lot going on in this code that I don't understand 100%. I just started reading about Promises and how they work. There's some regular expression stuff here too. I get the gist of what the code is doing. When you type in the input field, it's grabbing the value, filtering and matching what's in the cities array, and finally adding it back to the dom by using some template literal syntax and adding a class of hl(highlight) the the added results. 

**Link to works:** [Fetching Data](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/gBrpgJ)

### Day 30: Oct 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Array Cardio Day 2

**Thoughts:** Day 7 of the Wes Bos JS30 course. Woke up early to get my hour done. Learned how to use more array methods like .some, .every, .find, and .indexOf. This was a little easier to understand. This was a short one, so I was done like in half an hour. After that I started the new revamped [Treehouse course React Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics-2). 

**Link to works:** [Array Cardio](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/ZqWRPX)

### Day 31: Oct 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: HTML Canvas

**Thoughts:** Day 8 of Wes Bos's JavaScript30. This has been one of the coolest projects so far. There's also a whole lot here to further dig into. I'm guessing an HTML canvas element has an "API" that you interact with. The key to understanding how this is all working is by understanding how the **mousemove**, **mouseup**, and **moseout**. This is what is listening to mouse. 

After I was done with this one I spend perhaps the last 15 minutes on the Treehouse React Basics course. I'm going all the way back to the fundamentals and seeing how react works without JSX and Babel. I discovered today that Babel won't let you load up a locally, so I also finally figured out how to us http-server. Now I'm beggining to see how awesome and crucial create-react-app is. 

**Link to works:** [HTML Canvas](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/aRmmdr)

### Day 32: Oct 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Console Methods

**Thoughts:** Day 9 of Wes Bos JS30 course. It was a short and sweet one. This one was all about the different console methods. There's console.warn, theres console.error, console.info, console.assert, console.dir, console.time, and a couple more. After that I watched a bit more of the React Basics course. Getting a refresher in components. 

**Link to works:** [Console Methods](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/QZKZZL)

### Day 33: Oct 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 of JS30 and React Components and their props.

**Thoughts:** Checking multiple checkboxes. The logic for this one is not as easy to wrap my head around it. There's a handler, which is listening for a click and if the shift key is pressed. There is some value flipping. It's only 30 lines long, but it's pretty complex. It's also pretty beautiful.

**Link to works:** [The Art of Multi Checkboxing](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/wYozoJ)

### Day 34: Oct 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 11 of JS30

**Thoughts:** This was one of the longest projects from the Wes Bos course. This was all about how to create the functionality of a video with JS. There's some dom selection and a lot of event listeners. There's some ternarys. I always forget that querySelector only selects the first item and querySelectorAll, well, selects all of them. 

**Link to works:** [Custom Video Player](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/dgNpaP)

### Day 35: Oct 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 12 of JS30 Key Sequence Detection

**Thoughts:** This was a short and sweet excercise. Just 13 lines of code. Starts out by creating two const. One of them is the secret code. It adds an event listener on the window object and listens to the "keyup' even, which literally is listening for every key that is pressed. After I was done with the Wes Bos exercise, I did a bit of the React basics course. I'm at the part where it starts explaining state and class components. I'm almost done with this course. 

**Link to works:** [Type in the Secret Code](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/WapNOq)

### Day 36: Oct 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 13 of JS30 Sliding on Scroll

**Thoughts:** Today was a little different. I split my hour in two. In the morning I finished the React Basics tutorial. I did 30 minutes. Then after work I did my JS30 excercise. After playing with React for a bit, and then getting introduced to Vue, I think I'm gonna use Vue more. React for now seems too complex for the type of Front End I see myself doing. I think Vue should be to me. I like em both tho. The JS30 exercise was interesting. I'm not a fan of things moving in on scroll, or crazy parallax and that sort of thing, but I learned about the scroll even. I also got introduced to "debouncing" scroll events. 

**Link to works:** [Sliding on Scroll](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/rqmJGq)

### Day 37: Oct 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 14 of JS30 and React Components

**Thoughts:** Today's Wes Bos exercise was interesting. It's funny because before I started with the coding session, I was reflecting on what I have learned so far, what has stuck, and what I need to study a bit more deeply. I'm getting to a point where I'm starting to notice that I'm indeed getting more fluent, but there are still some things that haven't completely sunk in. The Wes Bos exercise was all about understanding the differences between a reference and a copy when it comes to bindings that reference one another. With strings and numbers, we can say let age = 100; then let age2 = age; Both have the same value of 100, but if we update say age = 200. age2 will stay at 100. The same rule applies to strings and booleans. With arrays and Objects it is a bit different. With these two we would have to make actual copies using methods like .slice() and Object.assign to not affect the original. It was a really cool and a taking a step-back-view exercise. 

After I was done with this exercise, I started the React Components course on Treehouse. This is another one of the revamped React courses. The import and exporting of modules is just a like crazy, but I suppose it's useful. 

**Link to works:** [Reference vs Copy](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/ZqyKwM)

### Day 38: Oct 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 15 of JS30

**Thoughts:** Today was only Wes Bos exercises. This was about locasStorage. There's some complexity here that I could dig more into. There things you have go around in terms of event delegation for the items that aren't created and the ones that are created. So I didn't fully understand how the clicks on the checkboxes are staying persisten. But I was a really interesting project that's taking me a little bit outside my comfort zone. At the end I have a typo, and it took some time to find the bug, but I'm getting way better at figuring where errors come from.

### Day 39: Oct 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 16 of JS30 and back to React Components

**Thoughts:** Today was about updating a CSS text shadow effect on mousemove. There was some math. There is some destructuring, which I'm finally getting. It's pretty simple. Basically it's a way to be able to assign multiple values using one line. After finishing this one, I started with the Treehouse React Components course. 

**Link to works:** [CSS Text Shadows](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/PyJzjW)

### Day 40: Oct 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 17 of JS30 and back to React Components

**Thoughts:** Today I sorted an array of band names. It sorts the bands in alphabetical order, but it discards the ones with the articld "The", "An", or "A". To do that you use a regex. To sort you use the .sort. Still not exactly sure what's going on in the sort function using that a and b variables. It checks if a > b and it will return 1 if true and -1 if false. I think the trick there is how arrays arrange items. If I'm not mistaken, the last item in the array is at postion -1. Not sure really how this works. This was a really short exercise. After I was done, I did some more of the Treehouse React course. Pretty sweet day.

**Link to works:** [Sorting Band Names without Articles](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/LgzXbo) 

### Day 41: Oct 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 18 of JS30 and React Components

**Thoughts:** Another short and "sort of" simple one. One important thing. A Nodelist is not the same as an array. So you would have to use Array.from to put the node list in an array, and then you can use array methods on it like .map, .reduce, et al. The whole ide with this one is grabbing the data-time attribute, which contains a string defining the minutes and seconds of how long the videos are, and then adding them all up by using reduce. Another thing I learned finally is the modulo % and what it does exactly. Math man. After I was done with this one, I did some more React. React can be pretty amazing when you understand what's going on, but it seems too complex for me for now for the day to day things I see myself doing as a Web Designer. I do want to keep giving it a shot. 

**Link to works:** [Tally String Times with Reduce](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/NOwozK) 

### Day 42: Oct 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 19 of JS30

**Thoughts:** This one was a long one. I worked on it this morning and I didn't even finish it. I still have 5 minutes to go. There's a lot to unpack in this one. You use the navigator.mediaDevices and I guess this is the thing that starts of the webcam. It's a super cool, but super complex stuff to understand. 

**Link to works:** [Unreal Webcam Fun](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/gBoVMw) 

### Day 43: Oct 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 20 of JS30

**Thoughts:** Today I made a speech recognition app!. This was super cool. The code is not super difficult to understand. All you do is add the window.SpeechRecognition. You add an event listeners that listens to "results". The speech reconigtion works by using your microphone of course. After this I did some more React. I'm pretty much done with the React course. Hoping on finishing it off tonight. Last thing I learned about Pure Components and PropTypes.

**Link to works:** [Native Speech Recognition](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/QZQqdz) 

### Day 44: Oct 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 21 of JS30. Starting learning more about Gulp

**Thoughts:** This one was a rather short one. The JS30 exercise was all about location data, and it's something that only really work on your phone so you can't see the results. The only way you can test this without deploying is by download Xcode and using the iOS simulator, but I couldn't because I don't have the latest version of Mac OS to be able to install Xcode. Since I already finished with the React courses. I started the [Gulp Basics One](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/gulp-basics).

### Day 45: Oct 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 22 of JS30. More Gulp

**Thoughts:** Learn a really cool effect that follows links on hover. After finishing with the exercise watched some more Gulp basics on Treehouse. I'm super beat today.

### Day 46: Oct 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 23 of JS30. More Gulp

**Thoughts:** This exercise for day 23 of the the JS30 course is super hella fun. The thing that's making the magin happen is the [SpeechSynthesisUtterance()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance) method. Once you get that going it's all a matter of adding the .speak method and giving the arg a text value. Sort of a short one, but paused through this one a lot because I really enjoyed it. After that I some more Gulp videos. Gulp so far seems interesting and a time saver, but my projects aren't that big, at least not yet.

### Day 47: Oct 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 24 of JS30. More Gulp

**Thoughts:** Made a sticky nav that gets display style of fixed once it's scrolled to the top. It works by using thew window.scrollY and the offsets. Nothing too fancy. Pretty cool. I'm almost done with the Gulp course. I'm super beat today.

### Day 48: Oct 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 25 of JS30. Finished the Gulp Course

**Thoughts:** Exercise 25 of the Wes Bos course was more about teaching the concept of event bubbling and event delegation. Super short and sweet one. I finished the Gulp course. I'll probably look more into Gulp later on. 

I feel like I have reached a plateu. I still don't understand how reduce works.

### Day 49: Oct 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 26 of JS30. Started a Node JS Course on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** Exercise 26 of the Wes Bos course is super cool technique to to show dropdown menus. It's based on the Stripe [website](https://stripe.com/). There's a particular method that's key and it's called getBoundingClientRect(). That's what makes the background of the dropdowns have a different width and height according to the size of the content in it. It's pretty cool. 

After finishing I started a Node JS course that teaches you how to build a dynamic website.

### Day 50: Oct 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 27 of JS30 and Node JS Course on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** This was a neat one. I learned how to scroll by dragging with the mouse. Key methods: pageX, offsetLeft. Events: mouseleave, mouseup, mousemove. After I was done I saw some more videos on Node.

### Day 51: Oct 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 28 of JS30 and Node JS Course on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** Short and sweet exercise. Just two more days and I'm done with the Wes Bos course. This was a revisit to the video player control one. It's a really cool effect. Watch some more Node vids. Node.js is so backend. It's interesting, but it's hard for me to get excited about.

### Day 52: Oct 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 29 of JS30 and Node JS Course on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** One more day and I'm done with Wes Bos 30 days 30 projects course. This one was really cool. It's complex, but since I have attempted similar projects for keep tracking of time and making countdowns, this wasn't as harder than other projects. There's the setInterval function and the Date object with it's methods. The node js course has been sort of a drag to be honest. But I've also just been passively watching it. But I'm still super interested in learning at least the basics.

**Link to works:** [Countdown Clock](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/JmxmwN)

### Day 53: Oct 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 30 / Last Day of JS30 and Node JS Course on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** Finished Wes Bos 30 JS Project. This was definitely one of the coolest courses I have taken. The last project was a game. A Whack-A-Mole Game. The setTimeout is key in this one. There were some Math.randoms and .rounds, and .floor. These were used so we don't get the same Moles going up.

I'm almost done watching the Node Js videos. I'll probably finish watching them tonight.

### Day 54: Oct 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Rethinking how I practice...

**Thoughts:** Today I didn't do any tutorials, nor watch any videos. Decided to take a step back and sort of figure out where I'm at. I've been thinking of giving myself a big project. One of those projects is redesigning my Portfolio. I want my Portfolio to reflect what my skills are at the moment which are Front End Development and Web Design. 

I did do some coding. I want to see if I can come up with simple projects like the ones on the JS30 tutorial. Things that I can complete in at least 1 hour. I made a very barebones shopping cart web app. It's mostly listening to clicks and adding those clicks to a variable to keep track of them, and then showing them on the page by way of plugging that variable to the elements .textContent. I'm pretty sure I have leveled up my JS skills since I started this challenge. The only thing I looked up was CSS Grid, since I've gotten rusty with that. But in terms of the 13 lines of code that I wrote, I understand every single line that I wrote.

### Day 55: Oct 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Rethinking how I practice...

**Thoughts:** Today was another day were I didn't have a concrete exercise or project in mind. They only thing I could think of is going back to trying to make a mobile nav menu a la bootstrap. If there's anything I'm realizing after all this is that I'm super rusty with CSS. A least when it comes to layout and aligning things. 

**Link to works:** [How does a Navbar Work?](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/aRxMGJ)

### Day 56: Oct 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Practiced Fundamentals

**Thoughts:** Didn't have anything planned today, so I just watched some short vids on Treehouse. They were mostly practice exercises. Did a 9 min one on Template literals. I have a really good grasp on this. Goodbye string concatenation, hello Template Literals with String Interpolation. It's beautiful. I also watched one on Closures. This was a longer one, clocking a bit over the 20 min mark. This is an important concept in JS, and probably why we now have three ways to assing variables. I did end up writing one of the dumbest app in the universe tho because I just wanted to write a few lines.

**Link to works:** [DOMB Manipulation](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/bmPEaG)

### Day 57: Oct 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Practiced Fundamentals

**Thoughts:** Another day of short workshop videos on Treehouse. I went through a couple of them. One was on conditionals. The basic if/else, the switch with case and breaks, and the ternary one, one of my favorites. It also explained how to use operands like && and || to do quick evaluations, or "short circuit" them. The other video I saw was on strict mode, and what the "use strict"; is all about. I'm using this from now on. 

**Link to works:** No links today.

### Day 58: Nov 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Did Some Flexboxing

**Thoughts:** Today I went through a short tutorial to practice some CSS Layout, specifically Flexbox. [Learn CSS Flexbox by building a photo card component](https://freshman.tech/flexbox/) I went through the exercise step by step, making sure I didn't just copy and pasted the code. I typed through almost every line except the svg stuff. One thing I'm learning is that you have to hand type the code line by line to really internalize it. Flexbox is pretty sweet. There's also some JavaScript in the there. Just click the heart icon.

### Day 59: Nov 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a Simon Game

**Thoughts:** Today I made a Simon Game with plain old Javascript. [This was a Free Code Camp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&v=n_ec3eowFLQ). I spent over an hour on this one. Was following and typing along and understanding everything that's going in the code, but I think I started to get lost somewhere between the play() function and the gameTurn(). I know that's where the sequence gets created and they are pushed into the order array. It uses Math.floor and Math.random to generate them. A set Interval is also used. It's a 200 line code. I'll definitely be coming back to this one. It's easy enough to understand, but also has some challenging logic.

### Day 60: Nov 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Came up with my own little thing

**Thoughts:** So today I worked on trying to make my own thing happen. After an hour of tackling the problem, I couldn't figure how to accomplish it. The end goal here, is to show different title descriptions. I think I'm starting on the right path, but can figure out how to plug in the diferent strings in the title element. Here's the breakdown: I have an array of sentences and I want to loop and plug each sentence in a p element. I know the looping is happening. I tried with a forEach and even the for i loop, but it's only plugging in the last string in the array. 

**Link to works:** [Looping through an array of Strings](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/VVwVxZ)

### Day 61: Nov 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Found a Solution

**Thoughts:** I knew that I was on the right path yesterday when trying to "loop" through an array of strings and showing each one to a paragraph element. The solution wasn't a for loop though. The solution was in the if statement. I implemented this solution by following a super [short tutorial on creating a slideshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YQ4svkETS0) The solution is still "looping" in a way, but it's conditionally looping, that way it will iterate though the array index and plug in the string.

### Day 62: Nov 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Ad Hoc and Random Day

**Thoughts:** Wasn't as structured today in what I wanted to tackle. I watched some videos first. It was a [Traversy Media video on ES6 Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBLIm5LMrmc). I highly recommend this guy's videos by the way. After finishing the video I just went through the motions and just started with some html and css. I'm getting a better handle on how to use Flexbox to make a nav bar. I ended adding an event listener to a button and making it create a paragraph element and adding it to the body. It's a pretty ridiculuos thing. 

**Link to works:** [Ridonculous](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/aQOwaK)

### Day 63: Nov 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Study Day

**Thoughts:** I have lost a bit of steam in terms of finding 1 hour coding exercises, or tutorials or ideas to code up that a least will keep me engaged for 1 hour. I also feel like I've reached the opposite of a plateu. Most of the projects, tutorials, or ideas I'm coming up with don't feel as challenging or interesting. I reached a level where I am comfortable with JavaScript in terms of dom manipulation and basic logic. I need a big project. Something that will keep me as engaged as the JS30 course. 

Not that I didn't code today, but it was mostly html and css. I just made some notes on some concepts. I went through a couple of [Travis McGinnis videos on ES6 concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vBYfLCE9-Q&list=PLqrUy7kON1meLrM6e7WW02jJ8QongnT7Z) I made some short notes on the html document. I finally have a better grasp on desctructuring and what that's all about.

**Link to works:** [Modern JavaScript Stuff](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/WYQNBG)

### Day 64: Nov 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Forms

**Thoughts:** Today I went through [John Ducket's JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1541614215&sr=8-2&keywords=javascript+and+jquery+jon+duckett) book. It's an old book and it's falling apart, but I keep coming back to it because it's such a great book. I have never finished reading this book completely, so I've been grabing it ocassionally and just browsing through chapters. I started from the last chapter, which is on Form enhancement and validation, and did some of the examples. It's interesting to see how now I can understand a lot of what's going on just by looking at code. The helper function was super cool and interesting. I'm beginning to see the reason behind libraries and frameworks. 

**Note:** IIFE's( Immediately Invoked Function Expressions ) are really awkward to write.

### Day 65: Nov 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Paint your Own Mondrian

**Thoughts:** In my search for project ideas, I stumbled upon [Jennifer Dewalt's 180 sites in 180 days](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) I remember finding her site a couple of years ago, and thinking of doing something like that. One that caught my attention was [her paint a Mondrian site](https://jenniferdewalt.com/mondrian.html). I peaked at the code a bit to have an idea how she accomplished this. She used jQuery to grab the background-color value and then plug it in to the blocks. I used plain JavaScript. It took me some time to find the getComputeStyles method, but I think it took me more time to make the whole Mondrain grid with css grid. I took some ideas from [Jen Simmons Responsive Mondrian CSS Grid Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtJ5p3h2A4) and modeled the grid from an [actual Mondrian painting](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=mondrian&chips=q:mondrian,g_1:original:ugTr9mDd-Gc%3D&usg=AI4_-kTktW9fAD4GJSDD5gWGtSiXOpJ6Xw&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipoPPP_sTeAhWlz4MKHbZ4BlUQ4lYIPCgH&biw=1439&bih=763&dpr=2#imgrc=CMBeh2KaB5QySM:).

### Day 66: Nov 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Back at playing with React / Another Todo App

**Thoughts:** I did about two hours today. Mostly been watching videos all day on React. I've been under the weather so I've been slow. I first attempted a tutorial on YouTube that teaches you how to make a lorem ipsum text generator, but I kept getting CORS errors. Then I did a short one that teaches how to do a todo app. I really want to keep at just plain JavaScript, but React just keeps popping up. There's something kinda messy with they way it works, but there's also something interesting. 

**Link to works:** [Another Todo List](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/mQEpqa)

### Day 67: Nov 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Tried Building a Donut

**Thoughts:** The flu has really kicked my ass this year. I've been under the weather for about two days, but today I'm dying. I just grabbe the first thing I saw today. I think I found this exercise through the [JavaScript Weekly newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-donut-chart-with-vue-and-svg/). It's all about working with SVG and it also uses Vue. But this is way to advance for me and it went through my head. I did get the circle up there.

**Link to works:** [Making a Donut](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/EOggom)

### Day 68: Nov 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: CSS Variables and Some JavaScript Voodoo

**Thoughts:** Feeling better today. My head was a bit clearer and the exercise I chose today was pretty easy to follow. This was another exercise I found through the JavaScript Weekly newsletter, [Advanced CSS Theming with Custom Properties and JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-theming-custom-properties-javascript/) Technically, they are not CSS Variables, but CSS Custom properties. I finally got to play with these, even tho I always use SASS. I also used a filter property. It's incredible how now you can  almost do some "programming" with CSS now. The JS part of the exercise was simply about changing the color theme by using document.documentElement.setAttribute in which the documentElement is the root or HTML tag and applying the dark theme.

### Day 69: Nov 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made a Punching Bag with Vue

**Thoughts:** I first found [this one on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjfpQlVem-8) but then I found the [newer and updated one](https://hackernoon.com/a-vue-to-a-view-a-punchbag-game-849bb239629) by doing a Google search. There's just something that's super intuitive to me about using Vue vs React. Just by looking at the code, I can easily figure out what's going on. It's simple to reason about. Of course, like everything, it can get as complex as you want it, but I can reason about more easily about Vue. 

**Link to works:** [Punching Bag](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/QJGRxE)

### Day 70: Nov 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Another Responsive Nav 

**Thoughts:** Easy and short one today. No JS today. Just markup and CSS. This one was a Workshop exercise on Treehouse, [Build a Responsive Navigation with Flexbox](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-responsive-navigation-with-flexbox)This one had some interesting stuff that I didn't know about. Particularly the rule that that splits up a paragraph in two columns. The Flexbox stuff was already familiar, but I'm getting more comfortable with using media querias with a "mobile first" approach which is using min-width instead of max-width. I've also been meaning to start making a more robust workflow in terms of how I use Sass. So I really want to go through the [Sass Guideline doc](https://sass-guidelin.es/) and really start applying it.

**Link to works:** [Another Responsive Nav](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/aQpREL)

### Day 71: Nov 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Trying to use SASS Guidelines and Create Workflows

**Thoughts:** I'm still going through the SASS Guidline doc. Of particular interest is to how start a a project, even if it's super simple. The [7-1 Pattern is a super useful guide](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) But it took me a while to build anything remotely useful. This is probaby the ugliest site I have ever made.

### Day 72: Nov 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Work with Fetch API / Treehouse Workshop

**Thoughts:** Started a [Treehouse Workshop that teaches how to use the Fetch API](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/working-with-the-fetch-api) The course uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and grabs images of different breeds of dogs. I stumbled into a problem though when trying to populate the Select tag by fetching all the breeds. I think the data structure was different when the course was made. 

**Link to works:** [Fetch API](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/oQwYPW)

### Day 73: Nov 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Work with Fetch API / Treehouse Workshop

**Thoughts:** Nothing exciting today. Finished the Treehouse Workshop. I'm loosing steam. I think it's time I start tackling my Portfolio. This is all I've been thinking about. I did code some crap up. 

**Link to works:** [Day 73](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/VVzmrK)

### Day 74: Nov 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Basic Day / Classes and Webpack

**Thoughts:** Another Basic day. Followed a short Free Code Camp tutorial on JS Classes. Have a stronger connection now on how the class Something extends SomethingElse works. React is really just JavaScript. I finished my hour today watching a workshop on webpack.  

**Link to works:** [Classes Stuff](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/RqZvQK)

### Day 75: Nov 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Local Storage Workshop on Treehouse

**Thoughts:** This was a 20 something minute workshop on [Treehouse on Local Storage](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/using-local-storage-with-javascript) I pretty much copied the code line by line and then followed along with the video. There's some pretty cool piece of logic going on in this code and I love helper functions. Key methods: localStorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem.   
JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.

### Day 76: Nov 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Dumbest Treehouse Workshop

**Thoughts:** I think I've done almost all video courses on Treehouse related to JavaScript. I think the only ones I haven't done are the Angular courses. I found a 30 minute workshop on Designing with Illustrator vs Designing in the Browser. The result of the project is in the link below. It's pretty terrible. But I slinged some markup and css. I ended up watching a video on YouTube on classes or the syntactic sugar that is classes.  

**Link to works:** [Dumb Class](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/NEwvOG)

### Day 77: Nov 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Math Quiz App with Vue

**Thoughts:** Out of all the JS libraries out there, Vue is hands down my favorite. Even with complex apps like the one I followed from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@NAPOLEON039/how-to-create-a-simple-math-quiz-app-in-vue-b36802b0f4c8), I find working with Vue intuitive. From now on, I will be making this library my main one.

### Day 78: Nov 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Light Markup, Styling, and Vue Basics

**Thoughts:** Today I just went through some basic boilerplate markup. Played with some SCSS. Finished it off by going through the Vue docs again, and making super basic stuff. Ended up making another todo list.

### Day 79: Nov 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Dribble Shot as Mockup to Markup and Reversing a String in Plain JS

**Thoughts:** One hour is certainly not enough to make even the simplest web site. Today I just took [a dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2905982-Marketing-Page-Exercise/attachments/601981) and decide to transfering to markup. Even tho I know that it can take hours to complete a single page site, I'm still surprised on how very little you actually get done in an hour. The CSS reached 89 lines, but all I did was a navbar and a "hero" section. I'm super proud of the navigation though. I have a great handle on making them with flex box. I also replicate the reverse string function with plain Javascript.

### Day 80: Nov 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Vue JS Project / Recreating a Plain JS Thing

**Thoughts:** Spent more than an hour today trying to figure out how to first, recreate [this project](https://codepen.io/JayCruz/pen/VVwVxZ) with Vue and I also wanted to add some animations to it. I did manage to get a good start by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daejkZdeq4A), but I couldn't inject the setTimeout on it, nor could I add the animations to it unless I created a boolean property.

### Day 81: Nov 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Simple Counter Using Vue

**Thoughts:** This was a very simple project, but it was something that I figured out by myself. No videos, no tutorials. When you work on your own little ideas, you solidify what you know. Not that this is an original idea, I was looking through Dribbble and saw [this counter animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/5552182-Stepper-VII), and decided to to see how close I can get to make it work that way. I have no idea yet how to make an animation like that, but I got the core functionality of it. It was a pretty straightforward and simple Vue app.

### Day 83: Nov 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started Advance CSS with SASS course with Udemy

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was the very first day were I didn't code. Lot's of things have been going in. I got a new role at my job. New things to process. But I'm back it again. I only have 17 days to go now. I purchased the [Advanced CSS with SASS course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/). One of things that got me sold on it was that they have a section dedicated to the CSS Architecture with 7-1 methodology.

### Day 84: Nov 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Advanced CSS Course

**Thoughts:** Did two sessions today. One in the morning and one in the evening. No big updates on the Natours website. Did refactor some of the CSS like many of the fixed pixel dimensions to rem's. I think it has finally sunk in that Rem is relative to the Root, and em is relative to the parent. There's was also some change into the class naming covention. Changed a couple of class names to the BEM(Block, Element, Modifier) Also get a refresher on the Cascade, specificity, inheritance, the !important tag(which you shouldn't be using only if it's absolutely necessary).

### Day 85: Nov 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of Advanced CSS Course

**Thoughts:** Another two session day. Taking advantage on the off days. Today I worked on alot of things. But the most fun thing was creating the folder structure with SASS and partial folders. I'm learning so many cool stuff. I even made a custom grid doing using the calc function. Used mixins. Used an attribute selector. Refactored all the code and nested things in their proper place. I'm loving this course!

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of Advanced CSS Course

**Thoughts:** There's no way I'm going back to writing CSS without SASS. Even for a one page site, using the 7 to 1 folder structure to to organize the structure of a page is so super helpful. The project is freaking awesome. Learning a lot. Haven't done any JavaScript in a few days. Need to get back to it for a bit.

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of Advanced CSS Course

**Thoughts:** Still on section 6 of the course. Creating cards to flip is pretty complex. There's a bit of markup to write, and then a whole lotta CSS. You can see my progress below but without the images.
